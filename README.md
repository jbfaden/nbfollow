# nbfollow
Follow mode for Netbeans, where you can have two windows side-by-side doubling the number of lines on a wide display

I was watching a video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHMHukIlJY, where he suggests that code should still be limited 
to 80 columns, so that it can be projected and printed.  It occurred to me that if you limit to 80 columns you easily have room for two pages, like a "book view" of code. 
In emacs this was called the "follow" mode, and I think it would be fairly easy to implement for Netbeans using its clone feature
and listening to the scrollpanes and keeping them adjacent.
